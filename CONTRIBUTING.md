# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing. A few quick guidelines:

- Fork the repo, create a feature branch, and open a PR against `main`.
- Keep changes focused and include a short description in the PR.
- For visual changes, include screenshots.
- Run a quick local test: `python3 -m http.server 8000` then open `http://localhost:8000`.

If you'd like me to add more contributor guidelines, tell me which workflow you prefer.
